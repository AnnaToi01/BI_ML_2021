# Ensembles
In this exercise, the functions for simple Random Forest were implemented using own python code as well as `sklearn` library. Using VotingClassifier optimal ensembles of models were picked. Also optimal hyperparameters were picked for XGBoost XGBRFClassifier and CatBoostClassifier.

In the folder, **code**, [`Ensembles.ipynb`](https://github.com/AnnaToi01/BI_ML_2021/blob/hw5_ensembles/hw5_ensembles/code/Ensembles.ipynb) corresponds to the solution of the exercises. In the folder **data** two files with the required data are found.
