# Linear Models, Gradient Descent
In this exercise, the functions for linear regressions were implemented using own python code as well as `sklearn` library. Also logistric regression was implemented the same way as well.

In the folder, **code**, following files can be found:
* [Linear_models.ipynb](https://github.com/AnnaToi01/BI_ML_2021/blob/hw2/hw2_linear_models/code/Linear_models.ipynb) - Jupyter notebook with the code
* [requrements.txt](https://github.com/AnnaToi01/BI_ML_2021/blob/hw2/hw2_linear_models/code/requirements.txt) - required libraries for python

Before starting to execute the code, execute the following code in terminal, in order to install all the necessary libraries into your enbironment:
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
