# K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm
In this exercise, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm was implemented for binary and multiclass classification and the corresponding classification metrics, such as precision, recall, F1 and accuracy were written, all in Python 3.8. The `sklearn` library was used to check the results. With the help of `sklearn` library method `sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsRegressor`, a regression problem was tackled as well. Hereby, it is illustrated that the KNN algorithm can be effective when the target variable is continuous in nature.
